## Description
    My project is a demonstration of a character walking animation against a looping, 
in depth backgorund. The project is controlled by the arrow keys, meaning that the character
and the background both move when the keys are pressed. The character and the background both
are designed after an underwater theme.
    The project.py file contains the code for this project, the requirements.txt file contains
the name(s) of the pip-installable libraries needed for this project, the img folder contains the
images used for the background and the characters, and the proposal.md file contains the proposal
for this project.
    In the design for my project, I had to consider how many classes to have, when to implement
the key presses for the game, and which variables should be self variables and which shouldn't.
In the future, I would like to add more actions for the character to do, such as a jump, and I would
also like to increase the size of the character in the future because I think it is a little small.
