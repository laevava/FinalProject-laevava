# Title
Final Project - Sprite Animation Loop

## Repository
<https://github.com/laevava/FinalProject-laevava>

## Description
The program will display an animation on screen through pygame. It will contain a running animation of a character
against a moving, looping background. The display will be controlled by arrow keys.

## Features
- It will display a character running animation.
	- I will learn how to create character sprites that will be condensed into a list. The list will loop through itself.
- It will display an in depth, looping background.
	- I will create a few backgrounds that loop through itself at different times to create that depth. I will also add a limitation
    before the loop ends. 
- It will have controls to show different sides of the character animation. 
	- When still, it will display a still image. When moving left or right, it will trigger the character animation loop that is a list.

## Challenges
- I will have to learn how to import sprites and art into a pygame display.
- I will have to learn how to loop through images and display those onto the screen.
- I will have to learn how to add limitations on how long an animation can go for.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome is that the character animation works well and the background loops through as well.
It would also be ideal for the background to have depth to it rather than being a flat image.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A good working outcome is a looping background without depth, and an animated character in some way.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Create the art for the character sprites.
  2. Create the art for the display background and floor.

- Week 2
  1. Load the images into python and display them through pygame.
  2. Loop the background, display it, and add limitations.

- Week N (Final)
  1. Import the character as sprites and create a walking loop animation.
  2. Learn how to use the arrow keys to start each walking animation.
